To create the container:
    - first make sure you can run the app locally (if not possible, just set the correct database parameters as explained in "run_the_app_instructions.txt")
    - From the main folder go to src->Frontend
    - run "ng build"
    - run "docker compose build"
    - run "docker compose up"
    - the app should be running now in "http://localhost:4200/"
    - to delete the container run "docker compose down"

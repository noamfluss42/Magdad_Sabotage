To create the container:
    - first make sure you can run the app locally (as explained in run_the_app_instructions.txt)
    - set the correct environment variables of the db in SuperAPI -> env_variables.env, they are uset in settings.py.
    - set the correct API_URL of the server in the environment field in docker-compose.yml.
    - now everything is set.
    - From the main folder go to src->Frontend
    - run "ng build". Important: do this step everytime you change something in src->frontend folder.
    - run "docker-compose up --build"
    - the app should be running now in "http://localhost:12581/"
    - the docker logs should look like this:

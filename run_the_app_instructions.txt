Running the app locally:
	- start with running the server:
	- Make sure you installed all the python packages listed in SuperAPI -> requirements.txt
	- From the main folder go to SuperApI -> SuperAPI -> setting.py line 81. Make sure the postgerSQL database is set to the listed parameters or change them. 
	- In the cmd, go to SuperPI, run "Python manage.py makemigrations" and than "python manage.py migrate" this step is one-time step.
	- run "python manage.py runserver 12580". The django server should work now.
	- you should see something like this: 
	"Starting development server at http://0.0.0.0:12580/

	  Quit the server with CONTROL-C."
	
	- now we will run the angular app:
	- in another cmd, go back to the main folder and then, go to the folder src -> Frontend
	- run "npm i"
	- if required, run "npm audit fix"
	- run "ng serve --port 12581"
	- The app should be running in "http://localhost:12581/"
